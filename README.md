# SQL-PROJECT
The project represents a database that keeps track of a driving school.
It includes 5 main tables: Instructors, Students, Garage, Vehicles, and Lessons. 
Each table has its own set of fields and relationships to the other tables. 
The Instructors table is connected to the Lessons table with a one-to-many relationship, as well as the Students table. The Garage table is linked to the Vehicles table with a one-to-many relationship. The Vehicles table is connected to the Lessons table with a one-to-many relationship. The Lessons table serves as the central table, connecting all the other tables. The project includes various SQL commands and operations such as creating tables, adding data, updating records, querying data, and managing other database objects like views, indexes and synonyms.
